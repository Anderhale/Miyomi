# Manga

<br>

:::details Where can I get the highest quality manga releases?
[Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/), [:mdi-clover:/co/](https://boards.4channel.org/co/) & [Madokami](/guides/manga/madokami). Manga image quality depends on the [**source**](/guides/digim) and how it's been ripped, with volume release usually being better than [**CaaS**](/glossary/manga#publisher) release. If you want to download officially translated manga, [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/) is always the best source, though some of the rippers upload upscaled SD rips. 

We have listed the most trusted rippers in the [**Nyaa section**](/websites.md#nyaa). Madokami mainly mirrors the nyaa releases.

# Anime

<br>

:::details Where can I get the highest quality anime releases?
The quality of the anime file depends on the [**source**](/glossary/anime#source) as well as how it's been ripped and encoded. In general blu-ray release contains the best quality with reanimated, uncensored or extra scenes. [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/), IRC and some DDL websites don't compress the uploaded file.
