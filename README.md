# Submitting a link

## ⛔️ Things we won't add in the wiki

1. Websites that are only or primarily for generative AI (Chatbot, roleplaying bot, ai art generator
   etc.)
2. Sites that
   - imitate other websites
   - are very small in size
   - are mostly paywalled
   - sell unofficial merch
   - exclusively sell sex toys
3. Adult content sites similar to OnlyFans
4. Software that's too general (for example Windows OS related or Tweaking for privacy)
5. Sites focused on lolicon or furry stuff
6. Sites found in the untrusted lists of [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/unsafesites) and/or
   [r/PiratedGames](https://rentry.org/pgames#untrusted-sites)

## ⚠️ Things we will try to avoid

1. Closed source software (with good FOSS alternatives)
2. Sites that only use hosters such Katfile, Nitroflare, DDownload and Rapidgator
3. Sites that aren't primarily for anime, but have it as a side product
4. Sites scraping only one source, such as gogo or zoro
5. Things that are too niche and/or have a small userbase
